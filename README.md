# 🧩 **Project: MindPal – Your AI Memory & Knowledge Twin**

### 🔹 Problem

* People forget information they learn (lectures, notes, research).
* Notes apps are static → you can’t interact or ask questions about your own knowledge.

---

### 🔹 Solution

**MindPal** is an **AI-powered personal knowledge assistant** that:

1. Lets users upload notes, PDFs, and text snippets.
2. Creates a **knowledge graph** connecting concepts automatically.
3. Allows users to **chat with their notes**:

   * Example: “Explain the key points of last week’s lecture.”
4. Uses **smart summarization + retrieval** to surface information in plain language.
5. Optional gamification: reminds you of forgotten notes (spaced repetition).

### 🔹 Demo Example

1. Upload a PDF or notes.
2. Ask your MindPal:

   * “Summarize this in 3 points.”
   * “Explain the link between concept A and B.”
3. App shows AI-generated answer + graph highlighting related concepts.

### 🔹 Tech Stack

* **Backend**: FastAPI / Flask (Python)
* **AI / NLP**: OpenAI API embeddings, LangChain
* **Knowledge Graph**: NetworkX (small MVP) or Neo4j (if scalable)
